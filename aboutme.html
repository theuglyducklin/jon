   There once was a boy who sprouted from a rock. Then he was discovered from the mountains in Taiwan and put in the Taipei Zoo. An old geezer who was visiting the zoo decided to adopt him. Jonathan’s accomplishments include destroying screen doors, tables, cars, hope, and dreams. His daily life includes being pulled over by police when going on field trips with his photography class, or wrestling tigers in the jungle. He once was hit by a car. He was ok, but he still had to pay the damages for the car. In second grade, he did not know how to catch a baseball, thus he let a ground ball bounce off his cup and into his gloves, and then proceeded to chasedown the baserunner like a madman. He enjoys eating soup dumplings to a point where if he eats 6-8 boxes by himself he will throw up. But thats ok. Although imcompetent with most things, he is most imcompetent with a skateboard. He once decided to skateboard in Target and his big head knocked down the entire aisle of scooters. He once fought a dragon, but was swallowed alive. The dragon then puked him back out because he just tasted so damn nasty. Mosquitos love biting him, but instantaneously die from his poisonous blood. Enjoys squatting in front of Seven Elevens while eating ramen. Yum Yum so fun. Expert at cleaning dog doodoo, cause practice makes perfect. There is nothing he can’t break. Rides into action with his super hideous green Prius.  </p>
