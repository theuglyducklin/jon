<div>Smaug is a fiery wood model that was conceptualized through the physical and movement characteristics of a wrench and a spring balance. To accomadate for the characteristics of the wrench, hexagonal bases were made and held together by woodsticks that orient themselves in a spiralling motion. To accomadate for the characteristics of the balance the entire model gradually sinks downwards. This is suppose to resemble the scene in the second hobbit movie where smaug attempts to eat Bilbo and the dwarves in the giant well/ditch place.
